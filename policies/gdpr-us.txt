US Privacy Policy Summary

Under US privacy regulations such as CCPA:
- Users must be informed if their personal data is being sold or shared with third parties.
- Companies must provide an opt-out mechanism for data selling.
- Consent is generally not required for collecting basic information such as name and email for internal use (e.g., newsletter signup), provided that data is not shared externally without notice.
- Storing such information locally (e.g., localStorage) is permitted if it's not shared externally and used internally.

This policy assumes compliance as long as:
- There is no third-party data selling.
- Basic form data is only used internally.
- Users are not tracked or profiled across services.
